# **Projector Mover on Rail**

We are controlling the movement of smart iinteractive projector left and right on a rail structure. Motor used is BLDC and for the speed and stopping a chinese BLDC, speed was used. Ultrasonics were also used for limiting the direction. (Proximity lenght )

### Programming

We are actually immitating like we are driving an electric scooter so there is throttle and brake, and for speeding we hold throttle per required speed and for braking we use controllers signals

### Material Used

1. Chinese BLDC speed controlller
2. Designed

### Tech stacks

1. Arduino framework (PlattformIO)
2. Easyeda for Schematic and PCB.

### Sample snaps of PCB and the projector
